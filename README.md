## Deific Fetter
A one-use item in the form of a small box / stone that will fully bind another player in place upon use. Useful for getting rid of people for a very, very long time.

## Forlorn Inscription
A magic blade that, upon kill, will resurrect the enemy and brutally cripple it.

### Torpeified
The effect given to the victim, with an array of things to make someone's experience a living hell.

1) The player will have restricted movement, and not be able to jump very high.
2) The player will have reduced mining speed and attack damage.
3) The player will be unable to eat at all times, essentially ruining regeneration.
4) The player will not be able to clear this effect at all, unless a debug stick is used on them or they are punched with a contract.

This effect will persist after death using a component.

## Postponed
A never-ending abyss that permakilled people will be sent to. Inside, they will have a list of things to make this eternal and agonizing.

1) All sounds will be muffled, including voice chat.
2) All colors will be dulled (might scrap)
3) Constant ambience will play, implying there are things hunting you.
4) Players cannot use items at all
5) Players cannot lose health or hunger.

The only way to free someone is with a God.
